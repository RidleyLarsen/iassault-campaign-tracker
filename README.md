# Imperial Assault Campaign Tracker

I built this project to track data in my Star Wars: Imperial Assault campaigns.
I think it will be better than a pen and paper.

It uses firebase to handle the data, Handlebars for templating, and jQuery for other logic.

Please notify me of any bugs, or just ignore them.
